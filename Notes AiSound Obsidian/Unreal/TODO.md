- Make parameter dictionaries values not strings but integers
	- use a tmap in unreal to fake a custom made enum
		-  **!! NOPE**, we're still not compatible with FMOD then and base METASOUND, this only works if there is a layer before metasounds and before middleware
	- 
- Metasounds needs the basic nodes (randomget, etc) to not only take wave files but also metasounds - **IMPOSSIBLE**
	- I probably will need to setup custom metasound nodes
- I need a node for reading dictionaries for switch sounds
