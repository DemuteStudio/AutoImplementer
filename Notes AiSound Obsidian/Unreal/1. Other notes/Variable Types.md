# Common Types
### FString
Is the optimized string class for Unreal Engine
### int32
Is a 32-bit integer type for unreal engine to ensure consistent size and behavior across platforms and compilers.
### float
same thing as any other float
### bool
same thing as any other bool

# Uncommon Types
### FName
FName is a type that represents a string that is used as a unique identifier in Unreal Engine. It is similar to the FString type, but it is optimized for fast comparison and hashing, which makes it useful for identifying assets, objects, and other resources in the engine.
### FVector
FVector is a type that represents a 3D vector with float-precision components. It is used to represent positions, directions, and other quantities in 3D space. FVector provides a variety of mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, dot product, and cross product.
### FRotator
FRotator is a type that represents a 3D rotation as a set of pitch, yaw, and roll angles. It is used to represent the orientation of objects in the world. FRotator provides a variety of mathematical operations, such as addition, subtraction, and interpolation.
### FTransform
FTransform is a type that represents a 3D transformation, which includes a position, rotation, and scale. It is used to represent the location and orientation of objects in the world. FTransform provides a variety of mathematical operations, such as multiplication, inversion, and interpolation.
